## How to Use

### Importing Icons

To import an icon, I will use the [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) library (you can use whatever library you want).

*Obs.: It's better if the icon is in the **SVG** format*

Follow the steps below:

1. Download the icon as ***SVG Optmized*** from the site

3. Go to the *area* that says "Place Your Icon Here" and move the imported icon and chenge it's size to fill the squared area

4. Done! Your icon is now in the default size!
