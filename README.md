# Gravit Android UI Kit
Material Design UI Kit for the Gravit Designer Software

## How to Use

### Choosing Color of Component

### Placing Text

1. 

### Importing Icons

To import an icon, I will use the [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) library (you can use whatever library you want).

*Obs.: It's better if the icon is in the **SVG** format*

Follow the steps below:

1. Download the icon as ***SVG Optmized*** from the site
2. Click on ***Place/Import*** from the Gravit Designer and choose the icon that you downloaded
3. Go to the *area* that says "Place Your Icon Here" and move the imported icon and chenge it's size to fill the squared area
4. Done!
